We are working to transform the delivery of medical care using technology. 



Telemed offers online medical consultation, collection of samples, and delivery of medicines. (<!--We also have a USSD service for those without internet connections:: This is scary, this is feature limited, this is hard to address security-->)
<!-- LONG TERM GOAL: PURSUE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN EAST AFRICA, WEST AFRICA, AND SUB SAHARAN AFRICA. -->


From data, countries across sub-Saharan Africa have 0.23 doctors for every 10, 000 people, against the best ratio of 84.2 doctors in the most developed countries, according to World Health Organization.

Telemed aims to cover this gap, by creating efficiencies and broadening the reach of underserved regions. There is no way we're going to quickly build enough hospitals in a short period to be able to reach everybody with the health care that they need. Telemed aims to breach the gap of availability.


For majority of Sub-Saharan regions, a lot of healthcare facilities and professionals are still centralized within the urban areas or the capital cities. So very many people across the country don&apos;t get the benefits of these highly skilled individuals. Telemed aims to bring efficiency with technology-first solutions that complement with existing infrastructure.

We work with a creative, tenacity, and vibrant team culture which holds ambitious vision for the future of African primary care. Helping address various challenges from healthcare insigts via data analytics to innovative distribution channels that address patient needs.


_ **We aim to transform most of existing infrastructure as virtual centers that can deliver homecare complemented by telemedicine services.**
_ **Partnerships with labs and pharmacies ensure that we oversee the delivery of end to end services ensuring regulatory measures are met.** 

_ **We belive in providing magical experience with last-mile telemedicine, reducing hospital queues, disease spread segmentations**


As we expand and embark on the next phase of growth, we are closely working to innovate with AI-powered E-Triage and similar features that offer end-user self-assessment platforms and integration of Artificial Intelligence into teleconsultations.
