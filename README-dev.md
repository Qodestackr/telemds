Nextjs 

Next.js file-based routing itself isn't inherently bad or "BS." It's a convenient and developer-friendly approach, but its performance depends on the complexity of your application and how you utilize it. Here's a more nuanced breakdown:

Strengths of Next.js File-Based Routing:

Simplicity: It offers a clear and intuitive way to structure your application. Each file maps to a route, making it easy to understand and manage. This is a major advantage, especially for smaller projects.
Performance Benefits: Next.js leverages techniques like SSG (Static Site Generation) and SSR (Server-Side Rendering) to pre-render pages or fetch data efficiently. This can lead to faster load times compared to traditional client-side routing, which downloads and renders everything in the browser.
Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits your code based on the used routes. Users only download the necessary code for the pages they visit, reducing initial load times.
Potential Performance Bottlenecks:

Limited Flexibility: For complex applications with many dynamic routes and nesting, file-based routing can become cumbersome. It might not offer the same level of flexibility as some dedicated routing libraries.
Scalability Limitations: As your application grows significantly, managing numerous files and routes within the pages directory can become less efficient. Maintaining a clean structure and avoiding overly complex route components becomes crucial.
The Key to Performance:

Next.js file-based routing can be performant for most web applications, especially smaller to medium-sized ones. However, performance depends on how you use it:

Simple routes with minimal logic or data fetching are ideal.
Complex route components with extensive logic or data fetching can lead to compilation delays during navigation.
Optimizing Performance:

There are various techniques to improve navigation speed in Next.js applications, even with file-based routing:

Memoization: Use techniques to avoid re-computation of expensive logic or data fetching within route components.
Code Splitting: Split large route components to improve initial load times.
SSG/SSR Optimization: Leverage SSG or optimize SSR data fetching to minimize server-side rendering delays.
Client-side Data Fetching: Consider fetching non-critical data on the client-side for faster initial render.
Lazy Loading: Lazy load components not immediately visible to improve perceived performance.
Alternatives for Complex Applications:

Next.js App Directory Routing (introduced in Next.js 13): This offers more control over layouts and data fetching for complex applications while maintaining some simplicity of file-based routing.
Dedicated Routing Libraries: For highly complex applications with intricate routing needs, explore libraries providing features like nested route parameters and wildcards.
In Conclusion:

Next.js file-based routing is a valuable tool, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. It excels in simplicity and offers performance benefits with the right approach. For complex applications, consider alternative routing options or optimize your use of file-based routing techniques to ensure smooth navigation experiences.
